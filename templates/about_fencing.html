                <p>Fencing is a sport with a rich history, blending strategy, precision, and athleticism. Originating from the ancient practice of swordsmanship, it has evolved into a modern Olympic sport.</p>
                <p>There are three forms of modern fencing, each using a different kind of weapon and having different rules:</p>

                    <li><strong>Foil:</strong> A lightweight weapon targeting the torso, with points scored by the tip.</li>
                    <li><strong>Épée:</strong> A heavier weapon targeting the entire body, with points scored by the tip.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sabre:</strong> A light cutting and thrusting weapon targeting the upper body, with points scored by the edge and tip.</li>
